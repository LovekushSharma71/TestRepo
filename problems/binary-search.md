## 📝 Code Review

### Approach Critique
> No architectural critiques apply.

### Highlights
The implementation correctly utilizes the standard binary search pattern, including the robust midpoint calculation (left + (right - left) / 2) to avoid potential overflow issues, which is technically sound despite JavaScript's number type properties.

### Common Mistakes
_Code is structurally sound. No common mistakes flagged._

## 🔭 Horizon Expansion

### 🛠️ Micro-Improvement (Syntax & Execution)
The current logic is optimal; however, using bitwise shift (mid = (left + right) >>> 1) is a common, slightly more performant idiom in environment-specific contexts for integer midpoints.

### 🏗️ Macro-Alternative (Architectural Trade-off)
An alternative approach is the 'Binary Search on Answer' variant if this were a minimization problem, or utilizing recursive tail-call optimization, though the iterative approach is superior for stack space efficiency.

## 💻 Submitted Code
```typescript
function search(nums: number[], target: number): number {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        // Using (right - left) / 2 to prevent potential overflow in larger languages
        const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] === target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1; // Target is in the right half
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Target is in the left half
        }
    }

    return -1; // Target not found
}
```
